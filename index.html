        <p>
          Today I did research for the project that I am going to work on. I
          will be working on <em>AI-Based Plant disease detection system</em>. I went
          through several research papers and online reading materials regarding
          the same. The references are as follows:

            ICML (2019).
            <p>
              This paper introduces EfficientNet, a model family that optimally
              scales width, depth, and resolution together for CNNs. It achieves
              state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer parameters and is ideal for
              mobile deployment, making it suitable for applications like plant
              disease detection.

            <p>
              This study presents a custom CNN model trained on the PlantVillage
              dataset to classify tomato leaf diseases with over 91% accuracy.
              It compares well against larger pre-trained models and shows that
              lighter architectures can be highly effective in agricultural
              diagnostics.

            <p>
              The authors compare full-leaf and segmented-leaf inputs in
              CNN-based plant disease detection. Their segmented CNN (S-CNN)
              model significantly outperforms others, achieving 98.6% accuracy
              even on unseen real-world images, emphasizing the importance of
              preprocessing.

              This work trains a CNN on over 14,000 tomato leaf images and
              integrates symptom visualization using saliency maps. The model
              achieves over 99% classification accuracy and provides visual
              explanations for disease predictions.

  <li>Continued working with the tomato disease subset of the PlantVillage dataset, which I had collected and organized earlier.</li>
  <li>While analyzing the dataset, I observed that the number of images per class (i.e., per disease type) was uneven. Some disease categories had a large number of samples, while others had very few.</li>
  <li>Recognized that this imbalance could lead to a biased model — one that performs well on dominant classes but poorly on underrepresented ones, resulting in inaccurate predictions.</li>
  <li>Started researching how to deal with this imbalance and came across the concept of class weighting as a form of normalization during training.</li>
  <li>Learnt how to assign class weights in TensorFlow so that the model gives more importance to the minority classes, helping it generalize better across all categories.</li>
  <li>Implemented class weights in my training configuration — ensuring that classes with fewer images contribute more significantly to the loss function.</li>
  <li>This way, the model is encouraged to pay more attention to the underrepresented classes, even if it sees fewer examples of them during training.</li>
